## General Info
Pawssier is _the all-in-one tool_ for pet parents. Our pet profiles can store vet records, vaccine due dates, visual descriptions, photos, and microchip numbers. These profiles help you stay up to date on vet visits and locate your pets if they get lost.

Pawssier also has information on various pet breeds and diet requirements, courtesy of [Purina](https://www.purina.com/). This information can help you decide if your home is a good fit for a new furry friend. If you think you're ready to expand your family, you can start your adoption search with us too! You can find adoptable animals from [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) on your dashboard.
